# ItalianPastaQuiz
The quiz app is the third project for the Udacity Android Basics Course. This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Planning your app design before coding.
- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
- Creating, positioning, and styling views.
- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
- Commenting and documenting your code.

This app helps you to learn the specific name of different types of italian pasta.
There is a list of images and some options for the name.
